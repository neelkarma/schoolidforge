A mobile app for storing and easily using multiple SBHS Student ID barcodes.

## Build Instructions

1. Install the Flutter SDK.
2. Clone this repo and open it in a terminal.
3. Run `flutter build apk` if building for Android and `flutter build ipa` if
   building for iOS. This command will probably take a bit.
4. Build outputs will be in the `build/app/outputs/` directory.
