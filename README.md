# School IDForge

A mobile app for storing and easily using multiple SBHS Student ID barcodes.

## Installation

Download the latest `.apk` file (Android) or `.app` file (iOS) from
[Github Actions](https://github.com/neelkarma/schoolidforge/actions/) and
sideload onto your device accordingly.

> Warning: iOS support is untested and may be extremely buggy since I don't have
> access to a Mac nor an iPhone.

## Building

1. Install the Flutter SDK.
2. Clone this repo and open it in a terminal.
3. Run `flutter build apk` if building for Android and `flutter build ios` if
   building for iOS (Mac Only). This command will probably take a bit.
4. Build outputs will be in the `build/app/outputs/` directory.
